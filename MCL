// OVERVIEW:            The MCL is a collection of mathematics functions for C++. The library uses templates as far as possible.
//                      All computationally intensive functions are multi-threaded as far as possible.

/// @mainpage Maths Class Library (MCL).
/// @section Introduction
/// The maths class library implements a number of maths functions and some maths functionality. Wherever possible, the functions
/// are multi-threaded. Extensive use is made of the Boost C++ library.
/// The library is written in C++17.<br>
/// The library is written as an operating system independent library.
/// @section Dependencies
/// The following open source libraries are required by the Astronomy Class library.
/// @arg Boost Library <a href="http//www.boost.org">Boost C++ Libraries</a>
/// @arg GCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">General Class Library</a>
/// @arg SCL <a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">Storage Class Library</a>
///
/// @section Compilation Control
/// The following macros control how the code will be compiled for various applications.
/// @li @b MCL_NOBOOST - Do not use the Boost C++ libraries. This should only be used on platforms where the Boost C++ libraries are
///        not  supported. By default the Boost C++ libraries are enabled.
/// @li @b MCL_NOMT - Do not use multi-threading. This should only be used on platforms where multi-threading is not available. By
/// 									 default, multi-threading support is enabled.
/// @li @b MCL_REALTIME - Compile in the realtime library support. By default this will not be compiled in.
/// @li @b MCL_NOSTRINGS - Compile without using strings. This is intended to be used for embedded applications.
/// @li @b EMBEDDED - Compile the library for embedded applications.
/// @li @b MCL_CONTROL - Compile the library for control type applications.
///
/// @section Projects
/// The Astronomy Class Library is used as the Astronomy Library by the following projects.
/// @li Astronomy Manager.  (<a href="http://www.astroManager.net">astroManager</a>)
/// @li The Robotic Observatory Project (<a href="http://www.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic Observatory</a>)
///
/// @section Development
/// The library is still under active development and is being expanded and improved along with the development of the astroManager
/// application.
/// @par Note
/// The classes within this library have been in development from 2005. As a result, all the code is not written using the
/// C++17 functionality. There is an opportunity to "clean" up the code by updating the code to reflect the C++17 standard.
/// All new code that is being developed is written to the C++17 standard.<br>
/// All C string functions will be phased out over time. Any new code should not include C string functions, but should rather use
/// the C++ std::string classes.
/// @par Reporting Bugs
/// Bugs are tracked on the bugzilla database used by <a href="https://bugzilla.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic
/// Observatory project.</a>. The bugs should be entered against the ACL project.
/// @par Source Code
/// The source code can be downloaded as a zipped file from the <a href="https://bugzilla.theroboticobservatory.org">The Robotic
/// Observatory project.</a>.<br>
/// The source code is also included in the source package for the <a href="http://www.astroManager.net">astroManager Project</a>.
/// Where it can be downloaded from the project site, or from the project site on github.
